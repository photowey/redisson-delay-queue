     * This method first converts the given pattern and path to the Ant expression path format.
     * The conversion rules are as follows:
     * 1. If the pattern or path contains a period ('.') or a colon (':'), it will be escaped to a slash ('/').
     * 2. Supports wildcard characters:
     * - `#` represents a single word.
     * - `*` represents multiple words.
     * <p>
     * After conversion, the method uses AntPathMatcher to perform the matching.
     *
     * @param pattern The pattern to match, supporting wildcard characters and escaping.
     * @param path    The path to match, supporting wildcard characters and escaping.
     * @return true if the path matches the pattern; false otherwise.
